# Projet Mobility: Interface graphique
The aim is to develop an open-source software that will allow studying the mobility of individuals in a given region, for representative populations. The software will estimate various statistics such as the number of trips, distance travelled, greenhouse gas emissions, categorized by mode of transportation and purpose of travel.

This interface allows you to select a single or multiple departments to visualize the flow between different types of destinations such as jobs, shops, schools, administration, sports, healthcare, entertainment, museums, and restaurants. 
It shows various graphs such as the volume of active trips, volume of selected destinations, flow of destinations measured by INSEE, flow of destinations generated by the model with alpha=0 and beta=0 and flow of destinations generated by the model.
